        THE JOURNEY SO <br /> FAR <br /> LOJAY
      </p>
      <br/>

     
     <p className="interview">
        From the streets of Lagos Nigeria to The O2 Arena London, Lekan Osifeso
        Jnr, also popularly known as Lojay has become an artist we’ve all grown
        to love both in the local and international space. Before his hit with
        Sarz, “Monalisa,” Lojay had already made a few heads turn in the
        afrobeats scene with songs like Whine and Bubble, Over the Bar, and
        Alomo.

        It’s no surprise the fast-rising star got to grace the O2 Arena
        with sounds from his EP titled “ LV N ATTN '' released on the 4th of
        June 2021. At the Wizkid in O2 concert, the artist got to perform a
        number of his singles, including his hit song with Wizkid titled after
        the EP LV N ATTN. Since his performance, Lojay has been booked and busy,
        from performing at the recent FENTY Africa launch to giving the world a
        surprise remix to Monalisa featuring Grammy award-winning RnB artist
        Chris Brown.

         In an interview with MTV in 2021, Lojay gave a little
        insight on the journey to creating his joint EP with Sarz, “If there’s
        one song that brings feels to me it’s LV N ATTN with wizkid” the artist
        expressed to MTV Interviewers. After what appears to be a whirlwind of
        shows, coupled with his rise to fame, we had a chat with the artist to
        unravel what a day in the life and mind of LOJAY is like from the music,
        and personal style, and everything in between.
