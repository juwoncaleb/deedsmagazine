        THE JOURNEY SO <br /> FAR <br /> LOJAY
      </p>
      <br />

      <p className="interview">
        From the streets of Lagos Nigeria to The O2 Arena London, Lekan Osifeso
        Jnr, also popularly known as Lojay has become an artist we’ve all grown
        to love both in the local and international space. Before his hit with
        Sarz, “Monalisa,” Lojay had already made a few heads turn in the
        afrobeats scene with songs like Whine and Bubble, Over the Bar, and
        Alomo.

        It’s no surprise the fast-rising star got to grace the O2 Arena with
        sounds from his EP titled “ LV N ATTN '' released on the 4th of June
        2021. At the Wizkid in O2 concert, the artist got to perform a number of
        his singles, including his hit song with Wizkid titled after the EP LV N
        ATTN. Since his performance, Lojay has been booked and busy, from
        performing at the recent FENTY Africa launch to giving the world a
        surprise remix to Monalisa featuring Grammy award-winning RnB artist
        Chris Brown.

        In an interview with MTV in 2021, Lojay gave a little insight on the
        journey to creating his joint EP with Sarz, “If there’s one song that
        brings feels to me it’s LV N ATTN with wizkid” the artist expressed to
        MTV Interviewers. After what appears to be a whirlwind of shows, coupled
        with his rise to fame, we had a chat with the artist to unravel what a
        day in the life and mind of LOJAY is like from the music, and personal
        style, and everything in between.

        We dug deeper into the what is a day in the Life of Lekan, oh we mean
        Lojay is Like, and it was much simpler than we would’ve imagined, he
        said; A typical day in the life of lojay is to wake up and make music
        unless I have press rounds or I’m taking a personal day but the usual is
        to wake up and go into the studio, that’s where I spend most of my time.
        From the simple life to talks about fame, it was time to speak with the
        rising star on how he has grown a huge fan base both nationally and
        internationally over a short period, and how that made us curious about
        what it has been for him, “I’m extremely grateful for all the love and
        support, words can’t even describe the level of gratitude I feel towards
        everyone supporting me and making my dreams come true. Keep pushing the
        music, keep showing love, I genuinely love every single one “It just
        gives me the drive to keep going!”.
