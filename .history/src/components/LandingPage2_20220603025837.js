          From the streets of Lagos Nigeria to The O2 Arena London, Lekan
          Osifeso Jnr, also popularly known as Lojay has become an artist we’ve
          all grown to love both in the local and international space. Before
          his hit with Sarz, “Monalisa,” Lojay had already made a few heads turn
          in the afrobeats scene with songs like Whine and Bubble, Over the Bar,
          and Alomo.

          It’s no surprise the fast-rising star got to grace the O2 Arena with
          sounds from his EP titled “ LV N ATTN '' released on the 4th of June
          2021. At the Wizkid in O2 concert, the artist got to perform a number
          of his singles, including his hit song with Wizkid titled after the EP
          LV N ATTN. Since his performance, Lojay has been booked and busy, from
          performing at the recent FENTY Africa launch to giving the world a
          surprise remix to Monalisa featuring Grammy award-winning RnB artist
          Chris Brown.

          <br />
          In an interview with MTV in 2021, Lojay gave a little insight on the
          journey to creating his joint EP with Sarz, “If there’s one song that
          brings feels to me it’s LV N ATTN with wizkid” the artist expressed to
          MTV Interviewers. After what appears to be a whirlwind of shows,
          coupled with his rise to fame, we had a chat with the artist to
          unravel what a day in the life and mind of LOJAY is like from the
          music, and personal style, and everything in between.

          We dug deeper into the what is a day in the Life of Lekan, oh we mean
          Lojay is Like, and it was much simpler than we would’ve imagined, he
          said; A typical day in the life of lojay is to wake up and make music
          unless I have press rounds or I’m taking a personal day but the usual
          is to wake up and go into the studio, that’s where I spend most of my
          time. From the simple life to talks about fame, it was time to speak
          with the rising star on how he has grown a huge fan base both
          nationally and internationally over a short period, and how that made
          us curious about what it has been for him, “I’m extremely grateful for
          all the love and support, words can’t even describe the level of
          gratitude I feel towards everyone supporting me and making my dreams
          come true. Keep pushing the music, keep showing love, I genuinely love
          every single one “It just gives me the drive to keep going!.

          A couple of people who seem to have caught the Lojay wave, describe
          the artist’s sound as unique but also fitting in the afrobeat scene.
          We wondered if he considered having what we are now calling the Lojay
          sound. He went ahead to describe his sound style of music as
          “constantly evolving” “From the music I dropped before the EP to the
          things I’ve been working on recently, down to my vocal texture. I
          don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable at any point for too long because
          I feel the need to evolve the sound and take it to a different place.
          I write better, flow better and sing better.”

          It was only fair we did a bit of snooping for the fans to figure out
          what the artist’s plan for the future was following the success of LV
          N ATTN, and he didn’t disappoint. We got to learn that he is currently
          working on a body of work, an EP that is scheduled to drop this year.
          “After a couple of songs definitely - the people want new music! -
          It's more music, more visuals and I’m booked all summer so I can’t
          wait to see everyone vibe to my songs - it’s really about to be a long
          year!”

        Describing his music as very intentional, very edgy and heavy with
        melodies, we couldn’t agree more with the artist on how the tone of his
        voice makes his style of afrobeat a lot sweeter to listen to. Of course,
        to conclude the interview, we had to touch on the 4 Hip TV Awards
        nominations, especially the Next Rated Song of the Year. The 2022
        Headies would be Lojay’s first year at the award ceremony, and in his
        words; he never imagined he’d be one of the nominees not to talk of
        being nominated in four different categories, he also mentioned that
        while he was working on the EP he never thought as far as the award
        show. If you’d like to know more about what goes on in the singer’s life
        and explore his discography, the singer is pretty active on social media
        @Lojaymusic.
